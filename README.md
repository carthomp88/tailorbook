# TailorBook
Welcome to the TailorBook project!

TailorBook uses several Node dependencies. You will need to install the following: 
* mongoose
* nodemon
* express
* ejs
* express-ejs-layouts
* cors
* dot-env
* bcrypt
* axios
* react

The app should be launchable from this .zip file. Once everything is extracted, you will need to start
the frontend app and backend server locally to use this tool.

To do this:
First, from this directory, navigate to 'client'

### `cd client`

Then, you can start the frontend app:

### `npm start`

Next, change directory to 'server:'

### `cd ../server`

and start the backend:

### `npm start`

The app should open automatically in your default browser. If this doesn't happen, you can access the app
by navigating to http://localhost:3000.

Note: This app defaults to port 3000 for the app itself, and port 8080 for the backend server. Unfortunately, these things are hardcoded right now (which we know is foolish) and changing either port would become very ugly quickly

Thank you for exploring our project!
